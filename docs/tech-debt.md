## Container image `npm install` is non-deterministic

**Where:** `packages/agent-server/Dockerfile`, the `RUN … npm install --omit=dev` step.

**What:** The image install resolves `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
(and its transitive dependency graph) from npm at build time. There is no
lockfile inside the build context, so two builds run against different
registry state can produce different `node_modules`.

**Why it's like this:** pnpm uses `workspace:*` in our `devDependencies`,
which `npm` refuses to parse. The simplest workaround was to strip
`devDependencies` inside the Dockerfile and let `npm install` resolve the
runtime deps from scratch.

**Risk:** A transitive regression in pi-coding-agent (or anything it
pulls in) is picked up by the next container rebuild even if our code
didn't change.

**Fix when revisited:** copy a deterministic lockfile into the image
(e.g. a generated `package-lock.json` produced from the workspace
manifest), or pin `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` to an exact version
and commit a frozen lockfile alongside the Dockerfile.
